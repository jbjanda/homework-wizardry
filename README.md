# homework-wizardry
Collection of my homework assignments and code I have built as part of learning to program. 
This repository is a collection of the source code I have used in various school projects while I learn
to code.

I will be posting most stuff using c#, since that is what I am currently learning. However, I may start posting code 
from SQL Server and some old Java assignments I have laying around as I have time.

Right now, I am spending this time to learn how to use Git and further myself as a developer.
